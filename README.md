# steamcmd

A docker container for Steam based game servers via [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD).

## Overview

Includes steamcmd and its dependencies.  Just run `$STEAMCMD_DIR/steamcmd.sh` in your own Dockerfile or via `docker run` or `docker exec`, etc.

## Disclaimer

These containers are designed to be used by Zobees to host game servers for friends and family, and therefore may not suit all use cases.  That said, we are all for flexibility and would welcome pull requests and issues.
